# Optical Character Recognition

## Overview
Optical Character Recognition(OCR) is used to extract texts from the images. Modern OCR models can extract text written in more than 80 languages. Mostly OCR is able to identify and extract text present along the two major axis of an image, but the advanced models are able to read the texts which are somewhat disoriented.

This model tries to extract text written in English language. Python package EasyOCR is being used for the same purpose.

## Libraries Used
- EasyOCR
- OpenCV
- argparse

## Output
Some of the OCRed images are:
